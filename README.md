# Bee üêù

Simple program to help solve the [NYTimes Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) using a dictionary of every English word, taken from [YAWL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elasticdog/yawl/master/yawl-0.3.2.03/word.list).

This is a rough solution, so the output will inevitably differ from NYT's word list. Some of their words may not be in this program, and **many** words in this program will not count in the game. If you want the actual answers, it should be pretty easy to look them up. This is just a fun experiment.

## Installation

See [releases](https://github.com/nmasur/bee/releases) page for binaries.

On macOS, you can also install from Homebrew:

```
brew tap nmasur/repo
brew install nmasur/repo/bee
```

Alternatively, build from source using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```
git clone git://github.com/nmasur/bee
cd bee
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

Run `bee`.

First, input all of the letters in the puzzle, with or without the required letter.

```
Letters: abcdefg
```

Then, add just the required (center) letter.

```
Required letters: a
```

The program will output the full list of possible words.


## Game Rules

1. Each word must be more than 4 characters long.
2. You can only use the letters in the puzzle, but they can be used as many times as you want.
3. The required letter (center letter) must be used at least once.
4. Every NYT puzzle contains at least one "pangram," in which every letter is used at least once.
